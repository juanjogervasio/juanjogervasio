<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: medium;">About me:</span></strong></p>

Hello! My name is Juan JosÃ© Gervasio, I'm a physicist from La Plata, Argentina. I am currently working as a teacher in various chairs 
at Universidad Nacional de La Plata while finishing my PhD in Mathematical Physics. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Quantum Field Theory and its applications, but also in data science and finance. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently turning from the academia to the industry by improving my skills in Python, SQL, VB and other languajes. 
- ðŸ«‚ Iâ€™m passionate about learning and assisting others to do the same! I'm always willing to help.
