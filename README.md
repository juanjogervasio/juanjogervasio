<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: medium;">About me:</span></strong></p>

Hello! My name is Juan José Gervasio, and I'm a physicist from La Plata, Argentina. I am currently working as a teacher in various courses 
at Universidad Nacional de La Plata while improving my knowledge in Data Analysis. 

- 🤓 I’m interested in Data Science and Finance, as well as Quantum Field Theory and Fluid Dynamics. 
- 🌱 I’m currently transitioning from academia to industry by improving my skills in Python, SQL, C and other languages.
- 👀 I'm always looking for understanding processes deeply and finding ways to optimize results.
- 🫂 I’m passionate about learning and assisting others to do the same! I'm always willing to help.
- 📫 You can reach me at juanjose.gervasio@gmail.com.
